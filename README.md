ðŸš€ Project Overview
In this practical project, I am building a Tours Booking Website from scratch, covering both frontend and backend development using the MERN stack. The project includes:

Backend (Node.js & Express): RESTful API to manage tours, users, reviews, and bookings.
Database (MongoDB): NoSQL database for storing tours and user data.
Frontend (React.js): Modern UI built with React, integrating API calls using Context API and Custom Hooks.
Payment Integration: (Upcoming) Stripe/Razorpay for booking payments.
User Authentication: JWT-based login and registration system.
Modern UI/UX: Built with Reactstrap, CSS, and responsive design principles.
